Let me walk you through the steps of my movie recommendation system project:

Import Libraries:
I start by importing essential Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. These will help me manipulate data and calculate cosine similarity.
Check the Current Working Directory:
I verify the current working directory to ensure I’m accessing the right files.
Change the Current Working Directory and Read Data:
I switch to the directory where my movie dataset resides and read it into memory.
Display the Shape:
I check the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
Select Relevant Features for Recommendation:
I identify the features (columns) that matter for movie recommendations, such as titles, genres, and metadata.
Display Information (Info):
I inspect the dataset to understand its structure and data types.
Check for Null Values:
I make sure there are no missing values (nulls) in the dataset.
Display the Selected Columns:
I list the specific columns I’ve chosen for recommendation.
Check Null Values in Selected Columns:
I specifically look for null values in those columns.
Replace Null Values with Null Strings:
If any nulls exist, I replace them with empty strings or appropriate placeholders.
Combine All the 5 Selected Features:
I concatenate or combine relevant features into a single feature vector for each movie.
Convert Text Data to Feature Vectors:
I use techniques like TF-IDF to convert movie titles or descriptions into numerical vectors.
Calculate Cosine Similarity:
Cosine similarity helps me find similar movies based on their feature vectors.
User Interaction:
The user enters a movie name they’re interested in.
Find Close Match for User’s Movie Name:
I search for a close match among the movie titles in my dataset.
Get the Similarity Row for the Selected Movie Index:
I retrieve the similarity scores for the user’s movie.
Sort Movies Based on Similarity Score:
I sort movies by their similarity scores in descending order.
Display Top Similar Movies:
I print the names of the most similar movies (top 30) based on their index.
Consolidated Code:
Finally, I provide the complete code that encompasses all these steps.
